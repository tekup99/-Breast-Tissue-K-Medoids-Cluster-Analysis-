The project is structured into multiple notebooks, each focusing on different aspects and methodologies to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and to derive meaningful insights.\n\n## Previous Notebooks\n\n1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n   - This notebook focused on understanding the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between variables through detailed analysis and visualizations.\n   - [Link to EDA Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarktunataalt/exploring-breast-tissue-data-eda-insights)\n\n2. **PCA and Distance Analysis**:\n   - In this notebook, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, and the appropriate distance metrics for clustering were determined.\n   - [Link to PCA and Distance Analysis Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarktunataalt/breast-tissue-pca-distance-analysis)\n\n3. **K-Means Clustering**:\n   - This notebook applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to the dataset, evaluated the optimal number of clusters using various methods, and analyzed the clustering solutions.\n   - [Link to K-Means Clustering Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarktunataalt/breast-tissue-k-means-cluster-analysis/notebook)\n\n## Current Notebook\n\nThis notebook aims to apply the K-Medoids clustering algorithm to the dataset and determine the optimal number of clusters. The steps involved include:\n- Using the Elbow Method, Silhouette Method, and Gap Statistic to evaluate the appropriate number of clusters.\n- Visualizing the clustering results with different numbers of clusters.\n- Analyzing the clustering solutions to identify the most meaningful and robust clustering configuration.\n\nBased on the analyses, it has been concluded that K-Medoids clustering with \\( k=4 \\) will be evaluated further in the final notebook. The \\( k=6 \\) solution, however, will be excluded due to the presence of an outlier forming a single-point cluster, which is not meaningful for clustering analysis. The 5-cluster solution increases overlapping compared to the 4-cluster solution, while 7-clusters, although supported by three methods, results in a single-member cluster and thus is also not practical.\n\nNote: The factoextra library, which is essential for some visualizations and analyses, is not available on Kaggle. Therefore, the code for these parts was executed locally and the results were uploaded. Those who wish to run the code themselves are advised to download and run it on their local machines.\n\n\n## Future Notebooks\n\nThe subsequent notebooks will delve into various clustering techniques using the identified optimal settings:\n\n1. **Hierarchical Clustering**:\n   - Performing hierarchical clustering and visualizing the dendrogram to understand the clustering hierarchy.\n\n2. **Hierarchical K-Means Clustering**:\n   - Combining hierarchical clustering with K-Means to refine clusters for improved results.\n\n3. **Model-Based Clustering**:\n   - Using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and other model-based techniques to analyze the data under different assumptions.\n\n4. **Density-Based Clustering**:\n   - Exploring density-based methods like DBSCAN to identify clusters based on data density.\n\n5. **Selecting the Optimal Clustering Method**:\n   - Comparing the results of different clustering techniques and using cluster validation metrics to select the best method.\n\nEach notebook will build on the findings of the previous ones, ensuring a systematic and thorough analysis of the Breast Tissue Measurements dataset.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(factoextra)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(cluster)\n\ndata <- read.csv(\"/kaggle/input/breast-tissue-impedance-measurements/data.csv\")\ndata <- data[,2:10]\n","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"r"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"scaled_pca_data <- prcomp(data, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)\nscaled_pca_data <- scaled_pca_data$x[,1:2]","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"r"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# OPTIMAL NUMBER OF CLUSTERS FOR K-MEDOIDS","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Elbow Method","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fviz_nbclust(scaled_pca_data,pam,method = \"wss\",nstart = 25)+\n  labs(subtitle = \"Elbow method\")","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"r"}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Elbow Method involves plotting the Total Within Sum of Squares (WSS) against the number of clusters (k) to identify the point where the rate of decrease sharply slows down, forming an \"elbow.\" In the attached plot, two potential elbow points can be observed: at 4 clusters, where the WSS significantly decreases and the rate of decrease becomes more gradual, and at 7 clusters, where another change in the rate of decrease is noted.
